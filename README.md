General
-------------------

The cable is a UFP (Upstream Facing Port) to DFP (Downstream Facing Port) device, for mobile device charging and data transmission, the DFP port is configured with a 10K resistor between the DC and Vbus pin of the USB-C male plug, which allows a current delivery of up to 3A for devices that require it, the UFP port is designed on a PCB (Printed circuit board), which has the functionality of connecting two FFC (Flexible flat cable) cables, for the transmission of power to the USB-C MALE, also in this design, we have two data transmission lines between the 2 FFC cables, to send and receive data between devices.
